<p>For this project I first googled gems that allow me to install bootstrap. In the search results I found a link that took me to rubygems.org with the rails command that I needed to install bootstrap into my ruby on rails command promt. I then installed sass rails gem on my command prompt. Then I went to app/views/pages folder and created a new HTML file called project_2.Once project_2 html file was created I went to my routes.rb to add a new route to be able to access my project_2 webpage through my home page. I used the "get 'pages/project_2'" to be able to do this. Finally I went to my pages_controller.rb file and added a def for project_2 so that whenever we want to view the webpage the command can know that we have a project_2 webpage. Finally I ran my rails server to make sure everything was working properly and then uploaded it to heroku.</p>
